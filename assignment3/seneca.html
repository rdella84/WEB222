		<p>
			With campuses across the Greater Toronto Area, Seneca offers degrees, 
			diplomas and certificates renowned for their quality and respected by employers. 
			Combining the highest academic standards with practical, hands-on learning, 
			expert teaching faculty and the latest technology ensures Seneca graduates are career-ready.
		</p>
		<h3>History</h3>
		<p>
			Seneca opened in 1967 as part of a provincial initiative to establish an Ontario-wide network of colleges of applied arts 
			and technology providing career-oriented diploma and certificate courses, as well as continuing education programs to 
			Ontario communities. The province was responding to the increasing need for sophisticated applied learning as technology 
			continued to change the nature of work and the provincial economy. General education was considered an important element in 
			postsecondary education, and breadth courses continue to be a part of every program. In 2001 colleges were granted the ability 
			to offer baccalaureate degrees. Seneca is one of six colleges that can offer up to 15 per cent of its program activity at the 
			degree level.
		</p>
		<h3>Student Life</h3>
		<p>
			The Seneca Student Federation, campus clubs, and athletics offer the chance to get involved in the wider community. 
			Energetic and active students take on the task of representing their peers in the SSF. Planning and promoting events, 
			participating in campus culture days, joining a club for interest, or going on trips for professional development 
			are only a small number of activities students can engage in. Senecaâ€™s student government and councils can play an 
			active role in student life, by offering programs and events along with running the campus pub and in-house radio station.
